1. Make LaTeX file with problem writeup.
2. Implement step by step instructions with guided intent. 
3. Q1: Localization with a Different Dataset
			 0) Either 1) Use Overfeat code to generate a bunch of proposals for various images; 2) Use Sun09 proposals.
			 0.1) Sun09 -> have them download directly! Guide them through the process I just did for re-organizing the image files.
       a) First, for every image in the directory, draw the object proposals on the images. (point: visualize the text)
			 b) Second, implement the proposal combination algorithm given in the Overfeat paper. Draw results and check sense.
			 c) Third, implement K-means clustering on the centroids of the proposals and resulting bounds boxes. Evaluate. 
			 d) Fourth, come up with your own idea for a proposal combination algorithm and see if you can improve results.
			 d2) Implement a Hebbian Competitive Learner that learns the bounding boxes with competition learning. Compete on x1, x2, y1, y2
			 e) Fifth (if time), implement an RNN which does this process after training
4. Q2: Implement Canny Edge Detection
5. Write up email to send to Andrea + Mark specifying direction/goals
6. Incorporate Yanchen code into LaTeX problem file. 
6. Incorporate Solutions in one file, and Starter Code in other file.
